# spectrum-visualizer
Visualize audio file spectra using JavaFX.

This project is based on a report for my 'Algorithms & Programming II' class.

## Algorithm
A simple recursive implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform is used to generate the spectrum. It is contained in the `SpectrumVisualizer` class.

## Technology
Contents of .WAV files are read using the Java Sound API. The GUI was built using JavaFX.
